Audio。Play sounds。built-in object of phaser.。Web audio is the default audio context.。var config = {。audio。var game = new Phaser.Game(config)。Load audio file¶。an array of file url。// scene.load.audio(key。scene.sound.decodeAudio(key。Audio data。A base64 encoded string。An audio media-type data uri。An audio media-type data uri。An ArrayBuffer instance。An ArrayBuffer instance。scene.sound.decodeAudio(audioFiles)。audioFiles。An array of {key。data。key)。Finished decoding all audio data。Unlock audio¶。Unlocks Web Audio API/HTML5 Audio loading on the initial input event.。scene.sound.unlock()。Play sound¶。Sound instance will be destroyed when playback ends.。scene.sound.play(key。config)。var sound = scene.sound.add(key)。sound.play(config)。Position of the Spatial Audio listener¶。scene.sound.setListenerPosition(x。x。y。The x/y position of the Spatial Audio listener. Default value is center of the game canvas.。Web audio only。Sound instance¶。Create sound instance¶。var music = scene.sound.add(key。// source of the spatial sound。source。distanceModel。rolloffFactor。coneOuterAngle。coneOuterGain。Source of the spatial sound。The horizontal/vertical position of the audio in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system.。Represents the longitudinal (back and forth) position of the audio in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system.。An enumerated value determining which spatialization algorithm to use to position the audio in 3D space.。The horizontal/vertical position of the audio source's vector in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system.。Represents the longitudinal (back and forth) position of the audio source's vector in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system.。A double value representing the reference distance for reducing volume as the audio source moves further from the listener. For distances greater than this the volume will be reduced based on rolloffFactor and distanceModel.。The maximum distance between the audio source and the listener。after which the volume is not reduced any further.。A double value describing how quickly the volume is reduced as the source moves away from the listener. This value is used by all distance models.。The angle。of a cone inside of which there will be no volume reduction.。of a cone outside of which the volume will be reduced by a constant value。defined by the coneOuterGain property.。The amount of volume reduction outside the cone defined by the coneOuterAngle attribute. Its default value is 0。meaning that no sound can be heard. A value between 0 and 1.。Set this Sound object to automatically track the x/y position of this object. Can be a Phaser Game Object。Vec2 or anything that exposes public x/y properties.。Play sound instance¶。Start playing。music.play()。Start playing with configuration。music.play(config)。config。Resume。music.resume()。
