Camera shake effect
A really cool feature of Phaser 3 is that of camera effects. Our game is playable but it will be nicer if we can add some sort of camera shake effect. Letâ€™s replace gameOver by:

gameScene.gameOver = function() {
  // shake the camera
  this.cameras.main.shake(500);
  // restart game
  this.time.delayedCall(500, function() {
    this.scene.restart();
  }, [], this);
}
The camera will be shaken for 500 miliseconds
After 500 ms we are restarting the scene by using this.time.delayCall, which allows you to execute a method after some time
